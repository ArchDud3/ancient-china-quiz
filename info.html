    <h1>Information</h1>
    <p style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px; font-size: 20px;">The first Emperor of China was a man named Qin Shi Huangdi, who reformed & united china completely. During his lifetime,
    he did things like uniting the Great Wall of China, Creating a unified money system and simplifying the writing.<br><br>However, he was paranoid. He constantly burned books against him,
    executed the opposition, and went all across the lands to find elixirs to receive immortality, and this is what is believed to have killed him.<br><br>But he wasn't too sure that he would
    live forever though, as he had a mausoleum built with ~8000 terracotta warriors, ~130 chariots, and ~600 horses. He did this so that when he died he would be able to conquer the second world
    with a standing military large enough to take over the world.<br><br>Anyways, Qin became emperor at the age of 13, and continued his reign for 35 years until death. But in his lifetime he
    standardised things like writing, money, weights and measurements. He also decided that the roads should all be the same, and all the wheels on carts should be the same size too, so that
    everyone could use the same roads, instead of some roads small and others wide.<br><br>This is Ancient China in a nutshell - Now, have a go at the <a href="quiz" style="color: #fff;">quiz</a>,
